# The 2D Shape Area Calculator ðŸ§®
## Aim 
To Calculate the Area of 2D shapes
## Purpose
The 2D shape Area Calculator is basic python script enables us to easily calculate Areas of 2D shapes.
## Short description
- This code is used find area of respective 2D shape by giving specified inputs. (Eg: If our 2D Shape is circle.To find Area of cirlce required input will be it's radius)
- **Libraries Imported:**  `math`
## Workflow
- Choose one option from the following 2D shape for which you need to find area
  - `Circle`
  - `Triangle`
  - `Square`
  - `Rectangle`
  - `Parallelogram`
  - `Trapezium`
  - `Ellipse`
- Enter required inputs properly as follows:
  - If `circle` is opted then, required input is `radius`
  - If `Triangle` is opted then, required inputs are `base` `height` or `sides`
  - If `Square` is opted then, required input is `side` 
  - If `Rectangle` is opted then, required inputs are `length` and `breadth`
  - If `Parallelogram` is opted then, required inputs are `length` and `breadth`
  - If `Trapezium` is opted then, required are `bases` and `height`
  - If `Ellipse` is opted then, required inputs are `axis`
- Based on the shape opted by the user, it executes that particular block of code and takes input from user and gives Area as output.

## Output
- **Area of Circle**
