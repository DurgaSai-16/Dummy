## **Conditional statements:**

**What are Conditional statements ?**

In any programming language we need a ability to check given conditions whether it is satisfied or not and allows execution of statements accordingly. Such ability is provided by Conditional statements also known as selection control statements.
- Conditional statements is controlled by boolean expressions in it.
- If the boolean expression is satisified i.e., true then it executes all the statements indented in conditional block.
- If the boolean expression is not satisified i.e., false then it ignores the statements inside the conditional block and jumps to the next line in the code.


**What is the use of conditional statements ?**
- Execute statements selectively based on the condition provided.
- This helps to improve efficiency of code by providing the ability to control of execution of code.
